# A/B Test a New menu using Alteryx 
## Project Overview:

The coffee restaurant would like to conduct a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu.

To minimize the risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. Denver and Chicago were chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two cities perform similarly to all stores across the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy to predict how well the updated menu performs.

Youâ€™ve been asked to analyze the results of the experiment to determine whether the menu changes should be applied to all store.
